Test/MockObject version 0.07
============================

* NOTE *

As of version 0.07, the add() method has been deprecated in favor of mock().
It continues to work, for backwards compatibility purposes, but you are
encouraged to migrate to mock().  (Thank you for using the module, though.  :)

Test::MockObject is a highly polymorphic testing object, capable of looking
like all sorts of objects.  This makes white-box testing much easier, as you
can concentrate on what the code being tested sends to and receives from the
mocked object, instead of worrying about faking up your own data.  (Another
option is not to test difficult things.  Now you have no excuse.)

Please note that it is possible to write highly detailed unit tests that pass
even when your integration tests may fail.  Testing the pieces individually
does not excuse you from testing the whole thing together.  I consider this to
be a feature.
