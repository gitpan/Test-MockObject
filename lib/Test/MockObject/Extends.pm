=head1 NAME

Test::MockObject::Extends - mock part of an object or class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Some::Class;
  use Test::MockObject::Extends;

  my $object      = Some::Class->new();
  my $mock_object = Test::MockObject::Extends( $object );

  $mock->set_true( 'parent_method' );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test::MockObject::Extends lets you mock one or more methods of an existing
object or class.  This can be very handy when you're testing a well-factored
module that does almost exactly what you want.  Wouldn't it be handy to take
control of a method or two to make sure you receive testable results?  Now you
can.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item C<new( $object | $class )>

C<new()> takes one optional argument, the object or class to mock.  If you're
mocking a method for an object that holds internal state, create an appropriate
object, then pass it to this constructor.

If you're mocking an object that does not need state, as in the cases where
there's no internal data or you'll only be calling class methods, or where
you'll be mocking all of the access to internal data, you can pass in the name
of the class to mock partially.

If you've not yet loaded the class, this method will try to load it for you.
This may fail, so beware.

If you pass no arguments, it will assume you really meant to create a normal
C<Test::MockObject> object and will oblige you.

=item C<mock( $methodname, $sub_ref )>

See the documentation for Test::MockObject for all of the ways to mock methods
and to retrieve method logging information.

=item C<unmock( $methodname )>

Removes any active mocking of the named method.  This means any calls to that
method will hit the method of that name in the class being mocked, if it
exists.

=item C<isa( $class )>

As you'd expect from a mocked object, this will return true for the class it's
mocking.

=back

=head1 CAVEATS

There may be some weird corner cases with dynamically generated methods in the
mocked class.  You really should use subroutine declarations though, or at
least set C<can()> appropriately.

There are also potential name collisions with methods in this module or
C<Test::MockObject>, though this should be rare.
